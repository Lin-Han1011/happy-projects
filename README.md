The repository contains my personal predictive modeling and data cleaning and data visualization projects. 

1. The 'Bank client churn project' aims to forecast/classify if a client will leave the bank or not. 
The dataset I used in my project is downloaded from Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/adammaus/predicting-churn-for-bank-customers. It contains 10,000 observations and 14 variables, including 13 independent variables and 1 binary dependent variable 'Exited' that records if a bank client churn or not churn. 
I firstly explored the dataset and visualized variables and correlations to check if the assumptions of logistic regression model are met. Then, I used variables to build a logistic regression model and the final accuracy is 81.5% and I also explore a random forest non-parameter model (accuracy is 86.85%) to compare with the logistic regression model, and further improvement will be made for both models after I learn more about predictive model building. 
2. The 'Data preprocessing capital budget Toronto project' aims to clean the dirty data, and then build a Tableau dashboard using Toronto open source data set "Budget - Capital Budget & Plan By Ward (10 Year Recommended)".The data set source is https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/finance/#463113ed-6ad1-c05f-9ed5-f8965f40f7d3. 
The topic is "Future 5 years opportunities of city construction projects in Toronto". The potential audiences are "Representatives of Construction firms". Firstly, I will help construction Firms figure out what is the 10-year (from 2015 to 2024) trend of governmentsâ€™ investment on Toronto Construction projects, especially the budget for next 5 years. Therefore, they can do some preparation in advance/increase their competitive advantages such as buying equipment or hiring employees and seek opportunities to increase profits by cooperating with Toronto government. Secondly, I will tell them where the top 5 districts in Toronto city construction planning are. Lastly, I will show them what the top 5 types of construction projects in these districts are.
